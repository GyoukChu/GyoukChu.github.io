앞서 Review한 Diffusion Model과, score-based model을 모두 통합하는 generalized framework를 제시한, SDE 논문을 최종적으로 리뷰하기 위해 몇 개의 논문을 살펴보자.

1. Estimation of Non-Normalized Statistical Models by Score Matching
2. A Connection Between Score Matching and Denoising Autoencoders
3. Generative Modeling by Estimating Gradients of the Data Distribution (NCSN)
4. Improved Techniques for Training Score-Based Generative Models
5. Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE)
